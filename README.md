## Summary ##
First off thanks for taking the time to look through my previous projects and let me welcome you to my simple rock, paper, scissors game. It was programmed in C# with .NET Core, the user interface is built with WPF and finally it is unit tested with NUnit. 

The goal of the game is to beat your opponent at Rock Paper Scissors, After inputting a name on the start page the player is presented with 3 buttons:
- A rock
- Paper
- Or scissors

When the player clicks on one of those butons that round is over and your opponent will leave a message saying whether you beat them or not. In addition to that your wins and losses are recorded at the top left of the window, along with your streak, highest streak and score. There is no end and your opponent is happy to play with you until the end of time if you so wish.

## Goal ##
The goal of this small project was to practice using and implementing the 4 pillars of object oriented programming, in a simple environment such as rock, paper, scissors. This execise also allowed me to practice programming as a whole and gave me the oppurtunity to try new things with my programming.

As you'll see from the screenshots I also took the opportunity to experiment with the UI design choices, in previous projects I made a habit of making everything a neutral and clean grey. This time I thought I'd go a bit more vibrant.

Another benefit of taking on this project was garnering more experience using GitHub but especially using git from the command line.
